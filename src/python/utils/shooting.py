"""
Process for automatically firing the laser as fast as possible.

Examples
--------

Import and instantiate our laser commander
>>> from utils.shooting import LaserCommander
>>> lt_worf = LaserCommander()

Start the laser controller process
>>> lt_worf.start()

Instruct the laser commander
>>> lt_worf.fire_once()
>>> lt_worf.fire_at_will()
>>> lt_worf.hold_fire()

By default, `fire_once` blocks execution until the laser reports that it has fired, but this can be disabled by passing 
`False`.

By default, `fire_at_will` does not block. To make it block until the laser has reported that it has fired one shot, 
pass `True`.

To fire multiple times in a row, blocking between each shot, use
>>> lt_worf.fire_multiple(n)  # fire n shots

Find out when the laser last fired (updated automatically)
>>> lt_worf.last_fired

You must remember to stand down the commander!
>>> lt_worf.stand_down()

You can (/should) use the Laser Commander in a `with` statement so that you don't have to remember anything, and errors 
are handled better:
>>> with LaserCommander() as lt_worf:
>>>     lt_worf.fire_at_will()
The Commander will be stood down automatically upon leaving the `with` statement (including error cases)
